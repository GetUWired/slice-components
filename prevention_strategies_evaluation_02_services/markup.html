                <h3>Virtual Controls</h3>
                <p>Virtual Controls creates algorithmically generated control groups – virtual controls – for use in evaluating alcohol and drug prevention studies. These two key advantages of virtual controls are: (1) pretest similarity to whatever prevention treatment group may present itself and (2) patterns of change over time that closely mimic the normal course of alcohol and drug use development. Virtual Controls makes evaluating new and adapted programs easier by reducing the challenges of recruitment, subject retention, and onsite data collection.</p>
