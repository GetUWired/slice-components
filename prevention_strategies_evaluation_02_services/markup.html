        <p>You need to demonstrate the efficacy of your health and wellness programming to gain and/or retain funding. We conduct health and wellness program evaluations using experimental and quasi-experimental designs, as well as provide consulting, training, and technical assistance to inform program improvement. Through collaborative evaluation, we use scientific methods and techniques to help you analyze, quantify, and validate the success of your efforts; building the capacity, effectiveness, and efficiency of your programs and organization.</p>

                <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Prevention Strategies conducts program evaluations using experimental and quasi-experimental designs, as well as provides consulting, training, and technical assistance to inform program improvement. We construct and implement surveys, focus group or one-on-one interviews, checklists, rubrics, and monitoring instruments, as well as data entry or analysis and report writing. Our strategy is to apply the methods of collaborative evaluation to build the capacity, effectiveness, and efficiency of programs and organizations.</p>

                <h3>Consulting</h3>
                <p>College campuses can benefit greatly from expert consultation from Prevention Strategies. Experienced consultants will support colleges and universities to adopt evidence-based programs, practices, and policies, implement them with fidelity, and conduct ongoing evaluation to inform program improvement and assess impact.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Controls</h3>
                <p>Virtual Controls creates algorithmically generated control groups – virtual controls – for use in evaluating alcohol and drug prevention studies. These two key advantages of virtual controls are: (1) pretest similarity to whatever prevention treatment group may present itself and (2) patterns of change over time that closely mimic the normal course of alcohol and drug use development. Virtual Controls makes evaluating new and adapted programs easier by reducing the challenges of recruitment, subject retention, and onsite data collection.</p>

                <h3>PACE</h3> 
                <p>PACE is a web-based, customized prevention coaching and dissemination tool. Designed to effectively support the implementation of training and educational programs, PACE positively impacts the culture and climate of member organizations.</p>
