# slice-components
A place to store useful, reusable design pieces and practice using git.

## Rules
1. Create a branch for the component you're working on using a name that describes the component.
2. Put all your code into a it's own folder that uses name the component name.
3. We'll take time during the monthly developer meeting to review new components and merge them to main, if they pass. 
4. Try and use a parent element as a wrapper with a fairly unique class name.
5. Use separate files for different types of markup (css, html, js). You can use whatever naming convention you'd like on these files. 
6. Include a screenshot .jpg or .png of what the finished frontend looks like.
