# slice-components
A place to store useful, reusable design pieces and practice using git.

## Rules
1. Create a branch for the component you're working on
2. We'll take time during the monthly developer meeting to review new components and merge then to main 
3. Try and use a parent element as a wrapper with a fairly unique class name
