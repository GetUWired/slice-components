# slice-components
A place to store useful, reusable design pieces.

## Rules
1. Create a branch with your changes
2. No merging into until the monthly dev meeting
3. We'll come up with more guidelines and suggestions about naming conventions 
4. Use a parent element as a wrapper with an id that is the name of the component and use that in all the sytles
